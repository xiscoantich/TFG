%CDF_9x7 (Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau wavelet)
%
%This biorthogonal wavelet filter bank is designed as a spline
% variant with less dissimilar lengths.  Originally published by
% Cohen et al., this filter bank has seen widespread use in
% image-processing applications. Initially used by Antonini, et al.
%
%Different variants appear, with different signs and/or scaling, the 
% most common one is where the low-pass filter coefficients are divided 
% by sqrt(2) while the high-pass are multiplied by the same factor. The
% one provided here ensures that DC and Nyquist gain are sqrt(2). 
% Be aware of that when comparing to other sources!
